# The underscores (__price) appear here because you're using a private variable to actually store the value. The __price variable is meant to be accessed only within the class, which is a Python convention for private variables (just a convention, not enforced).

# When you define self.__price, you're creating a private variable.

# In the getter, return self.__price accesses that private variable.

# In the setter, self.__price = new_price sets the value of __price.

# Why do you need the double underscores __ for __price?
# The __ (double underscore) signals that the variable is intended to be private (again, it's just a convention). This is a part of Python's name mangling system, which "hides" the variable by changing its name internally, like renaming it to _Product__price. This helps avoid accidental conflicts when subclasses try to access it, and also prevents accidental direct access from outside the class.

# Important: The double underscore doesn't completely make the variable private â€” it's still accessible by Product._Product__price. The name mangling simply makes it less likely that someone will accidentally access or change it.
